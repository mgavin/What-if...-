# What if...

This plugin attemps to answer questions that I had, basically "what if we were able to...".  

I wanted to make the ability to entertain those questions available to the public to play around with.

It's **IMPERATIVE** that you understand:  
<u>**THIS WILL ONLY WORK IN OFFLINE GAMES!**</u>  
**MODIFYING THE GAME TO GAIN AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AGAINST SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THE SAME IS**

THIS PLUGIN AIMS TO INSPIRE PEOPLE TO SEE THE POTENTIAL IN WHAT PSYONIX COULD INCORPORATE INTO THE GAME AT A GAMEPLAY LEVEL.

Offline games include every game mode that isn't online. So, you can try this out vs bots in a lan match, workshop map, a custom training map, etc.

Note: You need to re-enter the game mode when you change the settings.

So far it offers:

## 1. What if we had the ability to have a "Reverse Camera" binding instead of *only* the "Rear View"?

Turn your camera around 180^o^  with the push of a button instead of only being able to look behind your car.

You can keep your "Rear View" bind while you try this out, since there is an option to turn off that functionality while the "reverse camera" is enabled.

You can invert the swivel setting's inversion. This means that not only will the camera rotate around the left/right direction (Yaw), it will also rotate around the up/down direction (Pitch).
  
## 2. What if we had a bind to "cancel a flip" during a dodge?

At the press of a button, you can make sure to "cancel" the pitch momentum that your car carries through a dodge.

The pitch momentum is cancelled *\*completely*\* no matter where you're holding your stick (or mouse or whatever).

It will help you imagine what it would look like if you had the ability to *\*perfectly\** cancel your pitch during situations where you dodge, like during a half flip, or during a speed flip, or any other situation.

Possible changes:
  - Adding the ability to assign multiple keys to bind (this may come out as a separate plugin)
  - Other "what if" questions? 
    - I don't have any that I'm currently considering. I have so many other things that I want to work on that I'm not interested in thinking any up. Maybe if I get inspired, I'll change that.
