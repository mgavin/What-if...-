# What if...

This plugin attemps to answer a questions that I had, "what if we were able to...".  

I wanted to make it available to the public to be able to play around with.

# Disclaimer: 
It's **IMPERATIVE** that you understand:  
**THIS WILL ONLY WORK IN OFFLINE GAMES!**  
**MODIFYING THE GAME TO GAIN AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AGAINST SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THE SAME IS**  
<font size=100px>CHEATING!</font>

CHEATING IS A BANNABLE OFFENSE AND WILL NOT BE ENCOURAGED OR TOLERATED.

THIS PLUGIN AIMS TO INSPIRE PEOPLE TO SEE THE POTENTIAL IN WHAT PSYONIX COULD INCORPORATE INTO THE GAME AT A GAMEPLAY LEVEL.

Offline games include every game mode that isn't online, so, you can try this out vs bots in a lan match, or in a workshop map, or in a custom training map.

So far it offers:

## 1. What if we had the ability to have a "Reverse Camera" binding instead of *only* the "Rear View"?

Turn your camera around 180^o^  with the push of a button instead of only being able to look behind your car.

## 2. What if we had a bind to "cancel a flip" during a dodge?

At the press of a button, you can make sure to "cancel" the pitch momentum that your car carries through a dodge.

The pitch momentum is cancelled *\*completely*\* no matter where you're holding your stick (or mouse or whatever).

It will help you imagine what it would look like if you had the ability to *\*perfectly\** cancel your pitch during situations where you dodge, like during a half flip, or during a speed flip, or any other situation.

Possible changes:
  - Adding the ability to assign multiple keys to bind (this may come out as a separate plugin)
  - Other "what if" questions? I don't know. I have so many other things that I want to work on that I'm not interested in thinking it up. Maybe if I get inspired, I'll change that.
